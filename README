This is a very simple example to demonstrate how to get a post request parameters, both from the body and the url.

Make sure you have the following installed:
- nodejs
- npm

To test it, run the following:

Step1: clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/tonylui/example-express-post-data.git

Step2: install all the dependency via npm by 
npm install

Step3: open a terminal and run the following:
node index.js

Step4: open another terminal and run the following:
curl --data "key=Hello" http://localhost:3000/World

**Note: in the terminal you open in step1, you should able to see the log showing that the param received is 'World' and the body key received is 'Hello'
