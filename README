This is a very simple example to demonstrate how to get a post request parameters, both from the body and the url.

To test it, run the following:

Step1: open a terminal and run the following:
node index.js

Step2: open another terminal and run the following:
curl --data "key=Hello" http://localhost:3000/World

**Note: in the terminal you open in step1, you should able to see the log showing that the param received is 'World' and the body key received is 'Hello'
